# COS 217 Demo

This repository contains an example revamp of Princeton Computer Science's 
[COS 217](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos217/) course website. 
The demo was built using the [Primer](https://primer.style/) CSS framework and can be 
accessed [here](https://disstillwill.github.io/COS217-Demo/).

## Issues

The demo was thrown together very quickly, so there are a few minor issues:

* The footer does not stick to the bottom if the page content is not long enough
* Some of the page content was not converted to HTML from Markdown correctly
